# Metropolis-Conformation-Optimizer
This is a Repo consists of two modules:

1. A molecule conformation optimizer leveraging Metropolis algorithm on PDB atom files.
2. An experiment tool that can explore the converging behavioral for different temperatures.

## Metropolis Algorithm
Metropolis algorithm is an import Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for obtaining a sequence of random samples from a probability distribution from which direct sampling is difficult.







## Future Work/ Improvements
- Implement Metropolisâ€“Hastings algorithm.
- Perturbates one vector at a time.
- Use log plots to distinguish different kTs.
